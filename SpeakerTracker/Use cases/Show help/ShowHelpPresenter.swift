Once the amendment is dispensed with, only those speakers who have not already spoken to the main motion may continue to speak to it. \

do a long-press on the speaker and select the menu option to speak again. \n

Press the play button for the top clock when the speaker commences.  The stop button stops the timer and when the play button \

The term 'meeting' can be ambiguous.  We might say 'the meeting decided to ...'.  Here, 'meeting' refers to the group of people who are meeting. \

To ensure clarity, when a group come together to have a meeting, we will call this a 'meeting event'.  For the purposes of this app, a meeting event \
includes the name of the entity, the name of the group that is meeting (the 'meeting group'), the members of the meeting group and the date and \
