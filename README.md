# SpeakerTracker
An iPad app to help with managing formal meetings where, in a debate: 
- members of the meeting signal to the chair their wish to speak and they are placed on a list of those waiting to speak 
- it is necessary to track those who have spoken so they do not speak again if the meeting rules limit each member to one speech
- there are meeting rules that limit speaking time and speeches need to be timed. 

It is ideal for local government meetings.

## Try it out
An easy way to try the code is to download it as a zip file then open it in Xcode (a Mac application which can be downloaded from the Apple App Store or from the Apple Developer website https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ ).  From Xcode, the code can be run on an attached iPad or run in the simulator that comes with Xcode.
