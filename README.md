# SpeakerTracker
An iPad app to help with managing those sort of formal meetings where: 
- members of the meeting signal to the chair their wish to speak and they are placed on a list of those waiting to speak 
- it is necessary to track those who have spoken so they do not speak again if the meeting rules limit each member to one speech
- there are meeting rules that limit speaking time and speeches need to be timed. 

It is ideal for local government meetings.
